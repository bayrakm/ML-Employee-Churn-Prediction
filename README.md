# WELCOME!

Welcome to "***Employee Churn Analysis Project***" that you will be able to build your own classification models for a variety of business settings. 

Also we will discuss what is Employee Churn?, How it is different from customer churn, exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee churn dataset using ***matplotlib*** and ***seaborn***, model building and evaluation using python ***scikit-learn*** package. 

We will implement classification techniques in Python. Using Scikit-Learn allowing us to successfully make predictions with the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Descent, KNN algorithms.

At the end of the project, we will deploy our model using *Streamlit*.

Before diving into the project, please take a look at the project structure.

- NOTE: I assume that you already know the basics of coding in Python and are familiar with model deployement as well as the theory behind K-Means, Gradient Boosting Descent, KNN, Random Forest, and Confusion Matrices.
